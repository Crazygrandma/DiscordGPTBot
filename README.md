# DiscordGPTBot

Welcome to **DiscordGPTBot**, a feature-rich Discord bot built with the [Pycord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord) API and integrated with a local LLM (Large Language Model). This bot is designed to make your Discord experience more interactive, fun, and developer-friendly with a wide range of features.

## Features

- **Chat with a Local LLM**: Interact with a locally hosted language model for intelligent and dynamic conversations directly within Discord.
  
- **Custom Audio Playback**: Play custom audio files in voice channels for more engaging interactions.

- **Basic Development Reload**: Reload the bot's commands and settings on the fly, making development and debugging faster and more efficient.

- **Planned Features**:
    - **Voice-to-LLM Interaction**: A system to communicate with the local LLM through Discord's voice chat, powered by the [Whisper module](https://github.com/openai/whisper).
    - More to come as the bot evolves!
